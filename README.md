### Git-Rules
- **Create new branch for new feature**
	- Pull request to parent branch when done
- **Single responsibility commits**
	- Commit often ( Helps merging )
	- Try to keep adding files and changing files in seperate commits if possible
	- For commits = [ added feature, script and implemeted it ] < [added base] [wrote script 1] [implemented script 1 in base] [fixed script for base]
